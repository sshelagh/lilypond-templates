;;; Commentary:
;; A file to set up the use of LilyPond with auto-complete which can be found
;; at http://www.cx4a.org/pub/auto-complete.el

;; Lilypond has functions to extract keywords etc from the lilypond-words.el file which in
;; turn is extracted by a python script from the code itself. I wish it had a list of the
;; lilypond scheme functions too.

;; Just add
;; (eval-after-load "LilyPond-mode" (load-library "ac-lilypond))
;; to your .emacs file. Happy auto-completing!

;;; bugs: 
;; need to look at why the words beginning with \ do not show up. Needs to be part of
;; lilypond syntax table?
;; another thing which might be nice is to have is a hook in with auto-overlays package so that
;; the code completion is context sensitive. the regexps already exsist in lilypond code.

;;; Code:

(require 'auto-complete)
 
;(modify-syntax-entry ?\\ "w" LilyPond-mode-syntax-table)
; A failed experiment.

(defvar ac-lilypond-identifiers
  '((candidates
     . (lambda ()
	 (all-completions ac-target LilyPond-identifiers)))))

;; I need to do a mapcar on the list of keywords to put an extra \\
(defvar ni-LilyPond-keywords
  (mapcar (lambda (x) (concat "\\" x)) LilyPond-keywords))

(defvar ac-lilypond-keywords
  '((candidates
     . (lambda ()
	 (all-completions ac-target ni-LilyPond-keywords)))))
 
(defvar ac-lilypond-Creserved-words
 '((candidates
     . (lambda ()
	 (all-completions ac-target LilyPond-Capitalized-Reserved-Words)))))

 (defvar ac-lilypond-ncreserved-words
   '((candidates
      . (lambda ()
	  (all-completions ac-target LilyPond-non-capitalized-reserved-words)))))

(add-hook 'LilyPond-mode-hook
	  (lambda () "Makes autocomplete work in LilyPond mode (mostly)"
	    (make-local-variable 'ac-sources)
	    (setq ac-sources '(ac-lilypond-ncreserved-words
			       ac-lilypond-Creserved-words
			       ac-lilypond-keywords 
			       ac-lilypond-identifiers ;these don't work. why?
			       ac-source-abbrev
			       ac-source-words-in-buffer))
	    (auto-complete-mode 1)))
